Creeper is a simple tracking application that tells you
how much time you spent procrastinating on other applications
instead of doing your work.

| Build instructions |
======================
In the root directory, run:
autoreconf -i
Then it's the old ./configure; make; make install routine.

The program depends on:
- gtk+-3.0
- valac-0.12
- gee-1.0
- libwnck-3.0
Fedora 15: yum install gtk3-devel libgee-devel libwnck3-devel vala
Ubuntu 11.04: sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libgee-dev libwnck-3-dev valac
