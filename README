= Creeper =

Creeper is a simple tracking application that tells you
how much time you spent procrastinating on other applications
instead of doing your work.

It's a pretty simple project, that will hopefully turn 
into a GNOME tutorial. It makes use of GTK3 and libwnck (soon).

== Build instructions ==
The program is made with Vala, GTK+3, Gee, and Libwnck3.

If Vala can't find libwnck-3.0 (like in my Fedora 15), generate it by
installing libwnck3.0-devel and then generating the .vapi file:

cd /usr/share/gir-1.0/
vapigen --library libwnck-3.0 -d /usr/share/vala-0.12/vapi/ Wnck-3.0.gir --pkg gtk+-3.0
