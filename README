Creeper is a simple tracking application that tells you
how much time you spent procrastinating on other applications
instead of doing your work.

| Build instructions |
======================
The program depends on:
- gtk+-3.0
- valac-0.12
- gee-1.0
- libwnck-3.0
Fedora 15: yum install gtk3-devel libgee-devel libwnck3-devel vala
Ubuntu 11.04: haven't figured it out yet.

If Vala can't find libwnck-3.0 (like in my Fedora 15), generate it by
installing libwnck3.0-devel and then generating the .vapi file:
cd /usr/share/gir-1.0/
vapigen --library libwnck-3.0 -d /usr/share/vala-0.12/vapi/ Wnck-3.0.gir --pkg gtk+-3.0
